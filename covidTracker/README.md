# COVID-19 Tracker

In this pandemic situation, we are always curious to know about the most and less affected area by **COVID-19** virus.

In this project we can get the information of total-active-cases, total-recover, total-confirm, and total-deceased of a state.

I use the API https://api.covid19india.org/state_district_wise.json to track the live data of the state.
